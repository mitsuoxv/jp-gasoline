## Motivation

[Nikkei
reported](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA169350W1A111C2000000/)
on November 17, 2021 that Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)
is considering a subsidy to gasoline wholesalers to suppress gasoline
retail prices when they rise to higher than 170 yen per litre. At the
end of the article, Nikkei showed a skeptical view saying, “As the
number of retailers has decreased, the retailers may not reduce retail
prices even if wholesale prices fall.” So I would like to study the
relationship between retail and wholesale prices of gasoline in Japan.

## Get gasoline prices

Agency for National Resources Energy under METI publishes gasoline
prices in its [web
site](https://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/statistics/petroleum_and_lpgas/pl007/results.html#headline1).
Although the original retail price data include consumption tax since
April 1, 2004, I exclude consumption tax all over the period.

## Plot retail and wholesale prices

Yes, both retail and wholesale prices are rising.

## Plot price differences

Differences between retail and wholesale prices have been increasing
since 2016. The mean difference was 12 yen per litre from 2000 Jul to
2015 Dec, and is 18 in 2021 Sep. This may reflect the reduced
competition among retailers. You can see the number of retailers has
constantly decreased since around 1995 in the last page of [this
